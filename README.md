# ML_Inside_Out

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks explaining how each algorithm behaves intuitively with GIFs and images.

If it is a classification algorithm then how it behaves with different shapes of data(like circular or elipsical etc..,). You can change the data set and play with it..

If It is a regression algorithm., then we can see how it optimises function with each epochs.

Best part of all.., It is all written in Python in Jupyter-Ipython notebooks. You can easily play with the code with different datasets or your own dataset..

> #### It is best for small datasets with few hundred points.. Otherwise it might take longer time , as this is not as efficient as sklearn code..

### Happy Coding. :) :) :)
